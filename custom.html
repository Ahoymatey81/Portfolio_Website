                <h2>Website Needs</h2>
                <p>A website for a small business is not complete without certain design elements and content that your customers expect.  These items include but are not limited to the following:</p>
                <ul id="needs">
                    <li>Logo</li>
                    <li>Custom Colors and Fonts</li>
                    <li>Staff Page</li>
                    <li>Responsive</li>
                    <li>Social Media Links</li>
                    <li>Google Map links with location</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When a customer is looking at your website you want them to find the information they need.  This includes vital information such as where your business is located along with your hours and contact information.  People also want to connect with your business by looking at your social media links.  Social media allows your business to market items and give up to date information directly to customers.  A staff page allows your customers to meet you before they ever enter your store.  This type of information lets customers feel comfortable with trusting your business because they don't just see your business as a name, but as real people.</p>
                <p>Design aspects that keep customers interested in your website will prolong the amount of time they stay on your website.  Logos, fonts, and color choices all contribute to the atmosphere your website provides.  Your website will be a customer's first impression of your business! Creating a website that fits your brand is important.  A responsive website will allow any customer to access your website no matter what device they are using.</p>

                    <p>This slideshow of reviews can be changed out when needed very easily and styled with your choice of colors and fonts.</p>
